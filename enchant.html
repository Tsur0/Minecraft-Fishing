        Enchantments are another critical part of Minecraft. They allow you to enhance your set of gear with bonus statistics. Fishing Rods are part of this set of gear obviously, otherwise I wouldn't be talking about it on this page. The main issue is that Fishing Rods only have 2 unique enchantments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having only two unique enchantments for fishing, what could possibly be enhanced or turned more efficient? First of all, we have to list out what enchantments <i>can</i> be put on a fishing rod. They are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Unbreaking
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>
              Luck of the Sea
            </em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>
              Lure
            </em>
          </li>
          <li>
            Mending
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the best ways to get started with fishing, is to aquire a fishing rod with the <em>Mending</em> enchantment. The reasoning for this is that <em>Mending</em> will use experience gathered to repair the item you're holding. (In our case, when you fish you'll repair your own fishing rod.)

      </p>

      <h3>
        Lure
      </h3>
      <p>
        <em>Lure</em> is a simple yet effective enchantment. There are three levels for the enchantments.
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lure I</li>
          <li>Lure II</li>
          <li>Lure III</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        Lure as an enchantment cuts the amount of time for your hook to catch by five seconds. This stacks as the enchantment level goes higher.
      </p>
      <table>
        <caption>
          Hook Time in Seconds
        </caption>
        <tr>
          <th>
            Unenchanted
          </th>
          <th>
            Lure I
          </th>
          <th>
            Lure II
          </th>
          <th>
            Lure III
          </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            5-30
          </td>
          <td>
            0-25
          </td>
          <td>
            0-20
          </td>
          <td>
            0-15
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        In particular as to how this works, the amount of time until you hook onto a fish is predetermined when you cast your fishing rod. The time is chosen from 5 to 30 seconds. What Lure does is subtract 5 seconds per level from that predetermined time. Let's say that you cast your fishing rod, and your time is set to 15 seconds. With an unenchanted fishing rod, you'd have to wait the 15 seconds no matter what. If you had <em>Lure III</em> on your fishing rod, the hook would be instant.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Luck of the Sea
      </h3>
      <p>
        <em>Luck of the Sea</em> is an even more simpler enchantment. Luck of the Sea (LotS), as three levels to it.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Luck of the Sea I
        </li>
        <li>
          Luck of the Sea II
        </li>
        <li>
          Luck of the Sea III
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All that Luck of the Sea does is increases your chance to catch treasure from the fishing loot table. (Approximately 2% each level) Here's a table detailing your catch percentages.
      </p>
